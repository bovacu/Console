# Installation
Just import the Console.jar to your project and make sure to add the folder consoleAssets to your project too, at the same level as src folder.

# How to use it
You can use this console integrated to your IDE console (having less features) or instantiate a custom window (recommended option).
To instantiate the window, before trying to write anything with this library you have to write this line:
    
    Console.generateGraphicWindow(true);
